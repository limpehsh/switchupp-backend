# SwitchUpp Back End

> This was for a university project back in 2017. The goal was to make something social yet niche so all of us in the group were uninterested in the topic. Thus, we settled on the idea of reporting incidents of infrastructure flaws around the city since that was 'approved'.

> Here is the back end of this debacle using [Express](https://github.com/expressjs) and [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb).
